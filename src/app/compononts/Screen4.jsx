            Make your employees feel welcome and valued with a carefully crafted
            opening message. Aside from serving as a greeting, this space is
            also great for showing what your company culture is like by example.
            Share your thoughts on the company's beginnings and growth. Mention
            your vision for the company. Remember to express your appreciation
            and willingness to listen to everyone's ideas. And finally, remind
            each person how important they are to the bigger group.
